# ✅ Removed non-existent fields: source_url, is_saved
# ✅ pitches table: company_name remains (correct in production)
# ✅ All interfaces updated to match production database
# ✅ All API routes updated to match production database

### Expected Results:
# - No more 500 errors from database field mismatches
# - Job descriptions should save successfully
# - Pitch generation should work with Gemini API key
# - Database operations should complete without SQL errors
