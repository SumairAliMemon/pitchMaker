### Step 3: Check Vercel Function Logs
# 1. Go to: https://vercel.com/dashboard
# 2. Click on your pitch-maker project

### What to Look For in Logs:
# ✅ "=== GENERATE PITCH API STARTED ===" - API is being called
# ✅ "User authenticated: [user-id]" - Authentication works
# ✅ "Job description saved with ID: [id]" - Database save works
# ✅ "User profile found: [name]" - Profile exists
# ✅ "API Key exists: true" - API key is set
# ❌ "GEMINI API KEY IS MISSING!" - API key not set in Vercel
# ❌ "Gemini API Error Response: [error]" - API key invalid or quota exceeded
# ❌ "Error saving job description:" - Database schema issue

### Most Common Issues:
# 1. API Key not set in Vercel environment variables
# 2. API Key invalid or expired
# 3. Gemini API quota exceeded
# 4. Database field name mismatch
# 5. User profile not found/incomplete

### Quick Fixes:
# Issue 1: Go to Vercel → Settings → Environment Variables → Add NEXT_PUBLIC_GEMINI_API_KEY
# Issue 2: Generate new API key at https://makersuite.google.com/app/apikey
# Issue 3: Check Google Cloud Console for API usage/quotas
# Issue 4: Check database schema matches the code
# Issue 5: Complete user profile in the app first
